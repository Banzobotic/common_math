# A collection of common math functions

As its name suggests common_math provides ways to do common math functions more easily 
than with the standard library alone.

Currently, it only contains rounding functions, however may functions may be added in the future

## Modules

- **Rounding** - functions for rounding - offers rounding to a number of zeros, decimal places or significant figures

## Disclaimer

This project is still early in development and all parts of the api are currently unstable
