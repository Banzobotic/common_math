# A collection of common math functions

As its name suggests common_math provides ways to do common math functions more easily 
than with the standard library alone.

Currently, it only contains rounding functions, however more functions may be added in the future

You can find a changelog [here](https://github.com/Banzobotic/common_math/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

## Modules

- [**Rounding**](https://docs.rs/common_math/latest/common_math/rounding/index.html) - functions for rounding - 
offers rounding to a number of zeros, decimal places or significant figures

## Disclaimer

This project is still in early development and all parts of the api are currently unstable
however if there are breaking changes, I will make sure to bump the minor version 
so cargo won't switch version automatically
